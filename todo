Think about ownership of data
* document everything
recluster should give optimal chi
Large shape + clusters for tests
* Ignored parts of numpy api
  * String functions (numpy.char)
  * numpy.ctypeslib
  * datatype not applicable
  * datetime
  * float error handling
  * emaths should work out of the box
  * matlib is more or less deprecated
  * random will be custom, also no support for array_function yet
  * maskedarray is a bit pointless probably
  * io: load/save has own format (probably hdf5 style)
* To assess:
  * ndarray api
  * polynomial
  * set
  * sorting, searching
  * statistics
* Functional
  * todo (if possible ?)
    * apply_along_axis
    * apply_over_axis
    * piecewise
* Misc routines:
  * todo (easy)
    * may_share_memory, shares_memory
* I/O
  * Implemented
    * tomatrices, frommatrices, toarray, fromarray
  * Todo
    * define (hdf5 ?) format to store and retrieve TensorTrainArrays and TensorTrainSlices
    * interop with tenpy
    * interop with quimb
    * interop with itensor (?)
* Padding
  * Todo
    * pad
